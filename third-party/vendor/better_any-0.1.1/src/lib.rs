//! # Better Any
//!
//! Rust RFC for `non_static_type_id` feature has been reverted.
//! Which means in foreseeable future there will be no built-in way in rust to get type id for non-static type
//! let alone safely use it to downcast to a particular type.
//!
//! This crate provides tools to do these things safely for types with single lifetime.
//! Although looks like it is technically possible to extend this approach for multiple lifetimes,
//! consistent api and derive macro would be much harder to create and use because of the necessity
//! to properly handle lifetime relations.
//! Feel free to create an issue if you have actual use case where you need this functionality for multiple lifetimes.
//!
//! Also it has better downcasting that allows you do downcast not just from `dyn Tid` (like `dyn Any`) but from
//! any trait object that implements `Tid`.
//! So there is no more need to extend your traits with` fn to_any(&self)-> &dyn Any`
//!
//! MSRV: `1.41.0-stable`
//!
//! ### Usage
//!
//! Basically in places where before you have used `dyn Any` you can use `dyn Tid<'a>`
//!  - If your type is generic you should derive `Tid` implementation for it with `Tid` derive macro.
//! Then to retrieve back concrete type `<dyn Tid>::downcast_*` methods should be used.
//!  - If your type is not generic/implements Any you can create `dyn Any` and convert it to `dyn Tid`.
//! Then to retrieve back concrete type `<dyn Tid>::downcast_any_*` methods should be used
//!  - If your type is not generic and local to your crate you also can derive `Tid` but then you need to be careful
//! to use methods that corresponds to the way you create `dyn Tid` for that particular type.
//! Otherwise downcasting will return `None`.
//!
//! If all your types can implement `Tid` to avoid confusion
//! recommended way is to use first option even if some types implement `Any`.
//! If there are some types that implement `Any` and can't implement `Tid` (i.e. types from other library),
//! recommended way is to use second option for all types that implement `Any` to reduce confusion to minimum.
//!
//! ### Interoperability with Any
//!
//! Unfortunately you can't just use `Tid` everywhere because currently it is impossible
//! to implement `Tid` for `T:Any` since it would conflict with any other possible `Tid` implementation.
//! To overcome this limitation there is a `From` impl to go from `dyn Any` to `dyn Tid`
//! But `Any` and `Tid` deliberately return different type ids because otherwise `Type<'a>` and `Type<'static>`
//! would be indistinguishable and it would allow to go from `Type<'static>` to `Type<'a>` via `dyn Tid`
//! which is obviously unsound for invariant and contravariant structs.
//!
//! Although if you are using `dyn Trait` where `Trait:Tid` all of this wouldn't work,
//! and you are left with `Tid` only.
//!
//! ### Safety
//!
//! It is safe because created trait object preserve lifetime information,
//! thus allowing us to safely downcast with proper lifetime.
//! Otherwise internally it is plain old `Any`.
