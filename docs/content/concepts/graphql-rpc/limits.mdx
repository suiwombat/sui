title: Limits
---

The GraphQL service for Sui RPC is rate-limited on all available instances to keep network throughput optimized and to protect against excessive or abusive calls to the service.

## Rate limits
Queries are rate-limited at the number of attempts per minute to ensure high availability of the service to all users.

## Query limits

In addition to rate limits, queries are also validated against a number of rules on their complexity, such as the number of nodes, the depth of the query, or their payload size. These limits can be retrieved by querying the `serviceConfig` field. An example of how to query for some of the available limits follows:

```graphql
{
  serviceConfig {
    maxQueryDepth
    maxQueryNodes
    maxOutputNodes
    maxDbQueryCost
    defaultPageSize
    maxPageSize
    requestTimeoutMs
    maxQueryPayloadSize
    maxTypeArgumentDepth
    maxTypeArgumentWidth
    maxTypeNodes
    maxMoveValueDepth
  }
}
```
